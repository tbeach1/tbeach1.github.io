		<h2>About Me</h2>
																		<!-- About me Para. -->
    <p>My name is Tylor Beach and I am a transfer student from Johnston Community College. I am currently pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering as a Junior.
	I have chosen this degree because as a prior service member in the United States Navy I was not satisfied with my accomplishments.
	I felt as if I had no real-world skills to contribute to the world. For that reason, I decided to separate from the military to further my education.
	As I explored different degrees and careers, I could not find anything as interesting and intimidating as engineering. 
	Though I am not sure exactly what branch of engineering is right for me, my past experience with mechanical systems in the Navy helped me decide on a mechanical engineering degree
	</p> 
	<br />
	<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 20px; color:#00FFFF; text-align: center">
	At 27 years old I have worked at many different companies including everything from a stocker at a local grocery chain to working on million-dollar weapon systems.
	If I had to pick the one job that is significant to me, It would have to be my time in the Navy. While serving in the Navy I was fortunate enough to see many different countries.
	While working as a weapons technician onboard my ship in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii I oversaw a group of technicians maintaining the combat readiness of my systems.
	I was fortunate enough to visit places such as Jerusalem and Thailand while making lifelong connections with friends all around the world.
